## Uninstalling project dependencies (forced)

`pip uninstall -y -r requirements.txt`

## Save project dependencies

`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

# Testing
From the project root directory run the commands `cd src`

# Running unit tests

# Future Work (To be completed) âœ¨

### Building a local development container stack ()
run the command ```docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up -d```
